# video_slowMotion

A slow motion video generator that creates smooth slow-motion effects by leveraging optical flow interpolation. This Python tool uses OpenCV for video processing and Gradio for an interactive web interface, with optional CUDA acceleration for enhanced performance.

## Features

- **Optical Flow Interpolation:** Uses Farneback optical flow to generate intermediate frames for smooth slow motion.
- **CUDA Acceleration:** Automatically detects and utilizes CUDA if available, speeding up the optical flow computation.
- **Interactive Interface:** A simple Gradio web interface to easily upload and process videos.
- **Progress Indicator:** Displays a live progress bar during video processing using tqdm.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (both `opencv-python` and `opencv-contrib-python`)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Gradio](https://gradio.app/)
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash

python app.py
Interact via Browser:

Once the script is running, open the provided URL in your browser. Upload your video, adjust the slow motion factor (e.g., 2 for inserting one interpolated frame between each original frame), and click the button to generate your slow motion video.

Project Structure
processor.py: Contains the function to generate slow motion videos using optical flow.
app.py: Sets up the Gradio interface and integrates the video processing function.
